# Vaccination Scheduler

## Description

The Vaccination Scheduler is an intuitive, user-friendly web tool designed to assist individuals, caregivers, and healthcare professionals in managing a personalized vaccination schedule. Recognizing that the recommended immunization schedule can be complex and challenging to navigate, this tool simplifies the process by providing personalized vaccination plans based on the individual's age.

The Vaccination Scheduler takes an individual's age as input and promptly generates a comprehensive list of recommended vaccines, complete with the intervals at which they should be administered. This tool is particularly useful for those who might not be on a regular vaccination schedule or need a catch-up schedule, and want to ensure they're up-to-date with their immunizations.

It's crucial to note that while the Vaccination Scheduler provides a general guideline for vaccinations, it does not replace professional medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare provider for the most accurate and personalized information.

## Personal Note
This tool is a labor of conviction. As someone who believes in the importance of vaccinations in maintaining public health, I wanted to create something that makes it easier for people to manage their vaccination schedules. I hope it can make a small but meaningful impact.

Please feel free to contribute to this project! Whether it's suggesting improvements, reporting bugs, or adding new features, all contributions are welcome.

## How it Works

The Vaccination Scheduler is built using React. The application is composed of several React components, which manage the user inputs, calculate the vaccination schedule, and display the output.

Users enter their age, and the application calculates the recommended vaccines and their intervals based on that input. This is achieved by comparing the user's age to a pre-defined vaccination schedule, which is stored in a JavaScript object.

The calculated schedule is then displayed to the user in a readable format, providing a quick and easy way to understand which vaccines are due and when they should be administered.
